    <strong>I am on the job market this year, seeking full-time engineering roles in aerospace and robotics.</strong>
    If you or your team are hiring, don't hesitate to reach out!
</div> -->

I am a **Perception Software Engineer at [Zoox](https://zoox.com/)** (based in Boston), building the future of autonomous, rider-centric transportation. I am thrilled to be on the **Scene Understanding** team, which uses a mix of machine learning, computer vision, and planning techniques to navigate challenging driving conditions. Our team specializes in abnormal (yet safety-critical) situations (e.g., construction zones or flaggers directing traffic). It's an exciting time to be at Zoox -- [join us](https://zoox.com/careers)!

**I recently earned my Ph.D.** in Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering from Princeton University, where I was in the [Intelligent Robot Motion Lab](https://irom-lab.princeton.edu/) and [FAST Group](https://fluids.princeton.edu/), co-advised by [Ani Majumdar](https://irom-lab.princeton.edu/majumdar/) and [Marcus Hultmark](https://mae.princeton.edu/people/faculty/hultmark). My dissertation research improved aerial vehicle performance in the real world through tightly-integrated perception, planning, and control. Specifically, using high-dimensional sensors (such as vision and flow sensing) and machine learning to unlock new capabilities. During my PhD, I invented an omnidirectional flow sensor for UAVs [(patent)](#patents) and developed a wind-aware flight controller for gust rejection [(FlowDrone)](/flowdrone/). In addition, I advanced state-of-the-art in monocular micro aerial vehicle navigation through simultaneous depth estimation and 3D reconstruction [(MonoNav)](/mononav/).
<!-- My work aims to drive transformative autonomy in robotics applications such as urban air mobility, package delivery, infrastructure inspection, and ISR. -->

Here is a 3-min snippet of some of this work, from [Princeton Research Day](https://researchday.princeton.edu/):

Prior to the PhD, I received bachelor's and master's degrees in Mechanical Engineering from [Stanford University](https://me.stanford.edu/). Outside of work, I love to fly aircraft, and I was a member of both the [Princeton Flying Club](http://www.princetonflyingclub.com/) and [Soaring Tigers](https://soaringtigers.org/). I earned my instrument rating in 2023, and have written about my experience [here](./projects/instrument).

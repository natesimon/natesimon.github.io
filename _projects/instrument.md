Beyond the private pilot rating, the instrument rating is the next major milestone in any pilot's journey. It is a step from amateur flying into a more "professional" world, as you get to participate fully in the National Aerospace System. You can fly in clouds, above 18,000 feet (if your airplane allows), and with the same priority (and procedures) as the commercial airliners.

I started my IFR training in the Spring of 2016, in a Redbird FMX at the Advanced Flyers club in Palo Alto, CA. I continued my training at the New Century AirCenter in Gardner, KS while working at Garmin over the summer. 

## IFR Checkride

I conducted my checkride on April 23, 2023 with DPE Byron Hamby at KHZL (Hazleton Regional Airport). I was assigned to plan a cross country flight plan from Hazleton to Rutland, VT (KRUT). The forecast along our filed route and altitude was above the freezing level but below the overcast layer.
 
### Oral Exam

Here is a subset of the questions I was asked in my oral exam.

* What currency requirements do you need to act as PIC under IFR?
* In the forecast conditions, what is your decision regarding the flight plan to KRUT?
* At your filed route and altitude (clear of clouds but above the freezing level), could you pick up icing?
* What would you do if ATC assigns you to climb into the overcast layer?
* If you enter the clouds, what are you looking out for?
* Describe the types of structural icing and the conditions in which they occur.
* Which structures on the aircraft are most susceptible to icing?
* What are the consequences of picking up icing on the tailplane?
* How would you fly differently (cruise, approach, landing) assuming that you have ice on your tailplane?
* You notice that you are picking up rime on your leading edge. What do you do?
* Which approaches are available at KRUT?
* Why is there both an ILS Y and an ILS Z? (Hint: There is a major item here that you must pick up on.)
* Between the ILS Y and an ILS Z, which would you choose and why?
* What is the standard expected climb performance? (ft/nm)
* What is your aircraft's expected climb performance? (ft/nm) How would you calculate it?
* What would happen if your 

### Practical Exam

At the end of my oral exam, Byron casually briefed the approaches of my practical exam. I made sure to take notes to review the approaches during my break / preflight. He gave me a sample IFR clearance to Wilkes Barre (KAVP). He noted that I would take off, go under the hood at 500 feet, call Wilkes-Barre Approach and request the ILS 22, go missed, re-fly the ILS 22, go missed again, request the LOC 28 approach at KHZL, perform the procedure turn / holding maneuver at WEISS, (after holding) fly the LOC 28, land, takeoff, conduct unusual attitude recovery, and then fly the RNAV 10 (partial panel - loss of attitude), circle to 28.
